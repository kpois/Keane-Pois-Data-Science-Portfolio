# Welcome to my portfolio
In this repository are several projects which demonstrate key data science skills. 
## [Oakland Crime Statistics](../Oakland_Crime_Project/Final_Proj_Notebook.ipynb)
An exploration of crime statistics data hosted by the city of Oakland. In this machine learning problem, I explore and visualize 911 calls made from the years 2011-2016 and create a time series model to predict future crime rates.
## Works in progress:

## Santander Customer Prediction Competition
A data science competition submission using machine learning to predict a target variable
